# Launchpad95 OSD Mod (Launchpad98)

This project adds a dynamic on-screen display (OSD) and documentation assets on top of the original Launchpad95 Remote Script. It is intended to be layered on top of a standard Launchpad95 installation so it can be shared as a mod overlay.

**Download the original Launchpad95 first**
```

```

**Install Launchpad95 (base)**
1. Download and unzip Launchpad95 from the link above.
2. Copy the `Launchpad95` folder into your Ableton Remote Scripts folder.
3. Example path (Windows):
```
C:\Users\<You>\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\Launchpad95
```

**Install this mod (overlay)**
1. From this project, copy the modified files on top of the base `Launchpad95` folder.
2. Overwrite when prompted.
3. Use `MOD_OVERLAY_GUIDE.md` to see exactly which files are changed/added.

**Install the OSD device**
1. The modded OSD device is:
```
M4LDevice\Launchpad95OSD_Dynamic.amxd
```
2. Recommended: keep the entire `M4LDevice` folder together so the device can load `L95_ext.js` and the JSON UI sections.
3. If you copy the `.amxd` into Ableton's Max for Live Presets folder, make sure these folders are still in Max's search path:
```
M4LDevice\
Launchpad95 Mode Screenshots\
```

**Which OSD should I use?**
The dynamic behavior comes from `M4LDevice\L95_ext.js`. The modded OSD (`Launchpad95OSD_Dynamic.amxd`) is recommended because it includes the UI sections used by the script (info, mode guide, mode info). The original OSD can show basic info, but it will not expose all sections or dynamic layout features.
